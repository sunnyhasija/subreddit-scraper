# subreddit-scraper
This script scrapes all the posts and comments in the subreddit. You can give a list of subreddits, a start time and an end time. The script uses push-shift and the reddit api to scrape the comments. The output is a json file with the post, and all the comments, with a variable indicating what the comment is replying to.
